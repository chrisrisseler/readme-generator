  ## Description
  
  This small application will allow you to create a README by following prompts in the termimnal. It will help save time writing a good README file.
  
  ## Installation
  
  To install, make sure you clone the repo, then type "npm install" in order to download the necessary node modules. This will allow you to use the inquirer module.
  
  ## Usage
  
  To use the README Generator, first follow the installation instructions as detailed above. Then open the folder containing the index.js in the terminal and type "node index.js" in order to run the application. Then follow the prompts on screen as detailed in the video below. If you choose not to have a section, just hit enter and it will not include that section for you. You must include your github username and email though. In the end it creates a file called README.md and will overwrite any README.md that already exists in the folder.
